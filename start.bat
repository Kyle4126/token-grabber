 The above code is a simple example of a Python project that uses the  setup.py  file to define the project’s metadata and dependencies. The  setup.py  file is used to install the project’s dependencies and create an executable script that can be run from the command line. 
 The  setup.py  file defines the project’s metadata, such as the project’s name, version, author, and license. It also defines the project’s dependencies using the  install_requires  keyword argument. The  entry_points  keyword argument is used to define the project’s console scripts, which are executable scripts that can be run from the command line. 
 The  builder.py  file is the main script of the project. It defines a  main  function that prints some messages to the console and then exits. The  start.bat  file is a batch file that runs the  builder.py  script using the Python interpreter. 
 The  requirements.txt  file is used to define the project’s dependencies. It lists the names of the packages that the project depends on, one package per line. 
 The  start.bat  file is a batch file that runs the  builder.py  script using the Python interpreter. The  builder.py  script prints some messages to the console and then exits. 
 The  setup.py  file is used to install the project’s dependencies and create an executable script that can be run from the command line. The  setup.py  file defines the project’s metadata and dependencies using the  install_requires  keyword argument. The  entry_points  keyword argument is used to define the project’s console scripts. 
 Conclusion 
 In this tutorial, we have learned how to create a Python project that uses the  setup.py  file to define the project’s metadata and dependencies. We have also learned how to create an executable script that can be run from the command line using the  entry_points  keyword argument in the  setup.py  file.
